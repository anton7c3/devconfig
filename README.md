# devconfig

This is a place to store my personal configurations I use for development.
Nothing special.

# .vimrc

I'm using vim for my programming experience, mostly with Crystal, Python and
other small stuff. This config is a humble approach to make vim closer to
some of the IDEs, while still being faster than human can spot.

Feel free to use it if you see any interest in this.

# dot-gitconfig

Contains some useful aliases, convenient for daily use. Renamed from
`.gitconfig` to `dot-gitconfig` to exclude conflicts with repo.
